Loaded and cleaned a dataset of 8,000+ labeled emails, engineered features from email subjects and bodies, and trained models to distinguish spam from ham. Explored text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to maximize classification accuracy.","shortDesc":"Classified emails as spam or not spam using machine learning on real-world text data.","image":"/favicon.svg","tags":["data","python"],"category":"data100","featured":true},
