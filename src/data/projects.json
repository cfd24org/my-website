  {"id":"data100-projb2","title":"Data100: Project B2 — Spam Email Classification","repo":"https://github.com/cfd24org/data100/blob/main/projB2.ipynb","desc":"Built a machine learning pipeline to classify emails as spam or not spam using real-world text data. Loaded and cleaned a dataset of 8,000+ labeled emails, engineered features from email subjects and bodies, and trained models to distinguish spam from ham. Explored text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to maximize classification accuracy.","image":"/favicon.svg","tags":["data","python"],"category":"data100","featured":true},

Managed disk storage at the byte level, added support for file system syscalls, and optimized disk access with a custom buffer cache. Hands-on experience with systems programming, synchronization, and persistent storage.","image":"/favicon.svg","tags":["os","group"],"category":"cs162","featured":true},

Implemented a pipeline to generate zero-shot classifier weights from text templates, evaluated top-1 and top-5 accuracy, and visualized predictions. Demonstrated the power of vision-language models for classifying images without explicit training on target classes.","image":"/favicon.svg","tags":["cv","notebooks"],"category":"decal","featured":true},
